# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript:

Since this is the first I started it with writing website for buses in Somalia it’s just a dream for now, 
The first one is index where all the links and the face of the website, 
the second one is homepage where I displayed 4 pics as an ad for the web but as a reference it’s from Google images,
the second one is services where I wrote all the our services and one image, 
the other one is about us where I wrote our vision and who are we while using boots trap and also there is page links for jobs, 
variable and satisfaction which I used for variable, nesting, and inheritance,
and the last one is services which I used for css selectors and many other requirements in the project.


Thank you all!
