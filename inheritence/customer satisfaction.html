    <h1>reasons why customer satisfaction is important to us!</h1>

<ol>
      <li>  <div class="numer1"><h2>it is cheaper to retain customers than acquire new ones</h2>

This is probably the most publicized customer satisfaction statistic out there. It costs six to seven times more to acquire new customers than it does to retain existing customers.

If that stat does not strike accord with you then thereâ€™s not much else I can do to demonstrate why customer satisfaction is important.</div></li>

    
      <li>  <div class="number2"><h2>Satisfied customers give referrals</h2>
Nowadays, customers prefer to do business with companies that aren't just able to provide good products or services, but also with business that can deliver a seamless customer experience.

Ensuring your customer satisfaction means that your customers will be more willing to give referrals to friends and family, as well as recommend your business to other consumers.</div></li>

      <li>  <div class="number3"><h2>Many businesses nowadays rely on the relationships they've built with their audience.</h2>

You can't build those relationships without customer satisfaction. For example, building a brand helps businesses form good and long-lasting relationships with their target audience.

But, if your customers aren't happy with how you operate, even branding won't do you much good to remedy that. Ensuring customer satisfaction helps you establish good relations with your customers.

Satisfaction, however, doesn't always have to come from good products or exceptional service.</div></li>
